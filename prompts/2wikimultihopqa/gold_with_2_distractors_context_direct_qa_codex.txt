Wikipedia Title: Laughter in Hell
Laughter in Hell is a 1933 American Pre-Code drama film directed by Edward L. Cahn and starring Pat O'Brien. The film's title was typical of the sensationalistic titles of many Pre-Code films. Adapted from the 1932 novel of the same name buy Jim Tully, the film was inspired in part by "I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang" and was part of a series of films depicting men in chain gangs following the success of that film. O'Brien plays a railroad engineer who kills his wife and her lover in a jealous rage and is sent to prison. The movie received a mixed review in "The New York Times" upon its release. Although long considered lost, the film was recently preserved and was screened at the American Cinematheque in Hollywood, CA in October 2012. The dead man's brother ends up being the warden of the prison and subjects O'Brien's character to significant abuse. O'Brien and several other characters revolt, killing the warden and escaping from the prison. The film drew controversy for its lynching scene where several black men were hanged. Contrary to reports, only blacks were hung in this scene, though the actual executions occurred off-camera (we see instead reaction shots of the guards and other prisoners). The "New Age" (an African American weekly newspaper) film critic praised the scene for being courageous enough to depict the atrocities that were occurring in some southern states.

Wikipedia Title: Maria Alexandrovna (Marie of Hesse)
Maria Alexandrovna , born Princess Marie of Hesse and by Rhine (8 August 1824 – 3 June 1880) was Empress of Russia as the first wife of Emperor Alexander II. She was the mother of Emperor Alexander III and paternal grandmother of Nicholas II and Grand Duke Dmitri Pavlovich of Russia, one of the murderers of Rasputin. She was a daughter of Ludwig II, Grand Duke of Hesse, and Princess Wilhelmine of Baden. Marie was raised in austerity but was well educated by her mother, who took personal charge of her education but died when Marie was still very young. She was only fourteen years old when the Tsarevich Alexander Nikolaevich, later Tsar Alexander II of Russia, fell in love with her while he was traveling to Western Europe. She arrived in Russia in September 1840, converted to the Orthodox Church, took the title of Grand Duchess of Russia and traded the name Marie for Maria Alexandrovna. She married Alexander on 16 April 1841. The couple had eight children: two daughters and six sons. For fourteen years (1840–1855), she was Tsarevna, the wife of the heir of the Russian throne. She became the Russian Empress consort after the death of her father-in-law, Tsar Nicholas I. Maria Alexandrovna learned the Russian language quickly; she was pious and identified with her adopted country. She did not enjoy court life or the duties of representation as she was shy and of a withdrawn nature. As a consequence she was not popular. She took a more focused interest in charitable activities after the death of her mother-in-law the Dowager Empress Alexandra Feodorovna in 1860. Maria Alexandrovna was particularly active in the field of female education, establishing Russia's first all female schools. She organized the Russian Red Cross and expanded its activities during the Russo-Turkish War of 1877–78. She was deeply affected by the death of her eldest son the Tsarevich Nicholas Alexandrovich in 1865. By then, her fragile constitution was undermined by her numerous pregnancies and by tuberculosis which afflicted her since 1863. To avoid the harsh Russian winters, she spent long sojourns in the Crimea and in southern Europe. During many summers she visited her family in Jugenheim, where she had spent her childhood. Her marriage to Tsar Alexander II started as a love match and it was happy for some years, but Alexander II had many affairs and in 1866 he fell in love with Catherine Dolgorukova and had four children with his mistress. Maria Alexandrovna was treated with respect by her philanderer husband and she was much loved by her surviving children. After a long illness, she died in 1880. The Mariinsky Theatre in Saint Petersburg, the city of Mariinsk in Kemerovo Oblast, and the city of Mariehamn in Åland are named after her.

Nevada is a 1927 American silent Western film directed by John Waters and starring Gary Cooper, Thelma Todd, and William Powell. Based on the novel" Nevada" by Zane Grey, the film is about a former outlaw hired to protect a ranch owner's daughter, which angers the ranch foreman who is in love with the girl. The villainous foreman spreads a rumor of his rival's dark past to the sheriff, and the former outlaw is soon on the run again. Eventually he captures a gang of cattle rustlers led by the foreman, and with his reputation restored, he marries the girl. This lavish Western film was remade in 1944 as" Nevada" starring Robert Mitchum — the only time Cooper and Mitchum played the same role. " Nevada" still survives in a complete copy, but the film's appearance is not the best, due probably to poor preservation.

This was a very early Western role for Gary Cooper, but his fame in Westerns would be more noticeable in talking pictures.

Wikipedia Title: If I Have to Stand Alone
If I Have to Stand Alone is the debut album by Hi- NRG and house singer Lonnie Gordon, released in 1990 on Supreme Records. It includes Gordon's breakthrough hit" Happenin' All Over Again", which was a top 10 hit in the UK and Ireland. However, the two follow- up singles," Beyond Your Wildest Dreams" and" If I Have to Stand Alone" did not fare as well. The album was released in parts of continental Europe, Japan and Australia in late 1990 and early 1991, albeit in limited quantity, and was n't released in the UK until a Cherry Pop reissue in 2009. Most of the album was produced by British hitmaking team Stock Aitken Waterman or their associates Phil Harding and Ian Curnow. The album also includes Gordon's debut single for the label," It's Not Over", which was released in September 1989. The album incorporates Stock Aitken Waterman's typical Europop sound, but also adding influences of the Italo house scene that was big in the UK charts in late 1989/ 1990. Gordon recorded two more tracks which were not included on the album:" How Could He Do This to Me"( produced by Stock Aitken Waterman, and originally the planned follow- up to" Happenin' All Over Again"), and" Just a Matter of Time"( produced by Harding and Curnow). The former was later issued in the late 1990s on a dance compilation. Both were later released through iTunes in 2009.

Wikipedia Title: Metal Machine Music
Metal Machine Music( subtitled* The Amine β Ring) is the fifth studio album by American rock musician Lou Reed, released as a double album in July 1975 by RCA Records. A departure from the rest of his catalog, the album features no songs or even recognizably structured compositions, eschewing melody and rhythm for modulated feedback and guitar effects, mixed at varying speeds by Reed. In the album's liner notes, Reed claimed to have invented heavy metal, and asserted that" Metal Machine Music" was the ultimate conclusion of the genre. The album cost Reed credibility in the music industry while simultaneously opening the door for some of his later, more experimental material. Although reviewed negatively by critics since its release," Metal Machine Music" is today considered a forerunner of industrial music, noise rock, and contemporary sound art. In 2010, Reed, Ulrich Krieger, and Sarth Calhoun collaborated to tour playing free improvisation inspired by the album as Metal Machine Trio. In 2011, Reed re-released a remaster of" Metal Machine Music."
