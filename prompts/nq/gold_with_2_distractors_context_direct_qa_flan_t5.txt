Veterinary support personnel in Japan do not currently hold any official state recognition and are known under a variety of equivalent names. Credentialing is carried out by various private organizations. These organizations are the Japan Animal Health Technicians Association (JAHTA), the Japanese Animal Hospital Association (JAHA), the Japan Small Animal Veterinary Association (JSAVA), the All Japan Veterinary Co-operative (JVC), and the Japanese Society of Animal Nursing. The Japanese Veterinary Nurses & Technicians Association (JVNTA), a non-certifying body which closed its doors in 2007, was one of the original member organizations of the IVNTA. In 2009 the Japanese Veterinary Nursing Association (JVNA) was organized as an effort to unify and standardize the profession in Japan and to seek state recognition. The JVNA, which has the support of the Japanese Veterinary Medical Association (JVMA—the national organization for veterinarians), may serve only as a temporary vehicle towards a single permanent national certifying body. All of the organizations have been collaborating since 2010 as the Council for Veterinary Nursing Examination and have reached an agreement to share a common examination in February 2012.

Wikipedia Title: Open border
An open border is a border that enables free movement of people between different jurisdictions with limited or no restrictions on movement, that is to say lacking substantive border control. A border may be an open border due to a lack of legal controls or intentional legislation allowing free movement of people across the border ("de jure"), or a border may be an open border due to lack of adequate enforcement or adequate supervision of the border ("de facto"). An example of the former is the Schengen Agreement between most members of the European Economic Area (EFTA and the EU). An example of the latter has been the border between Bangladesh and India, which is becoming controlled. The term "open borders" applies only to the flow of people, not the flow of goods and services, and only to borders between political jurisdictions, not to mere boundaries of privately owned property.

In the subsequent siege of the Weaver residence, led by the FBI, Weaver's 43-year-old wife Vicki was killed by FBI sniper fire. All casualties occurred on the first two days of the operation.
